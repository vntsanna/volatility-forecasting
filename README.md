# Forecasting Volatility for Systemic Stress Assessment

This notebook compares traditional econometric models and modern machine learning techniques in forecasting **Euro STOXX 50** volatility and identifying episodes of systemic financial stress.  
It contrasts a benchmark **GARCH(1,1)** model with **Random Forest**, **MLP**, and **LSTM** approaches, and constructs a synthetic stress indicator inspired by the ECB’s Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS).

## Overview
- Clean, self-contained Jupyter notebook (no external scripts)
- Results highlight the predictive gains from non-linear machine-learning models over standard econometric benchmarks
